# Proxy-Connection
A very simple real life scenario is our college internet, which restricts few site access. The proxy first checks the host you are connecting to, if it is not part of restricted site list, then it connects to the real internet. This example is based on Protection proxies.

# Simple Example

If an application does not have access to some resource then such proxies will talk to the objects in applications that have access to that resource and then get the result back.

Try to enter >> google.com 
it will say << Access Denied >> because this site is mentioned in banned site 

Try to hit enter >> facebook.com
it will say << connecting to facebook.com >> as this website have no proxy block connection
